#Dog Party 2.0 Project

##HTML-DOM
This was the week 1 solo project for the 1908 Front End Engineering Cohort. We were tasked with replicating a provided comp, and providing
some additional functionality and responsiveness. Utilizing semantic html elements I divided the web page into a header, main, first and second
half sections, with divs breaking those sections into further pieces, and finally a footer. 

Originally I sped through this without giving much thought about the layout, more so about being able to replicate the comp provided. I ended
up going back and replacing the divs I used with sections. I was surprised to find how much I was able to remove while still executing the
desired result.

##CSS 

For the stylesheet we were not allowed to utilize some of the new CSS features available (grid/flexbox) and so I created div containers
